<p>AT1 is an 'autotuner', normally used to correct the pitch of a voice
singing (slightly) out of tune. Compared to 'Autotalent' it provides an
improved pitch estimation algorithm, and much cleaner resampling. AT1 does
not include formant correction, so it should be used to correct small errors
only and not to really transpose a song. The 'expected' pitch can be controlled
by Midi (via Jack only), or be a fixed set of notes. AT1 can probably be used
on some instruments as well, but is primarily designed to cover the vocal
range. It's also usable as a quick and dirty guitar tuner.</p>

<p> The rotary knobs can be used in two ways:</p>
<p> * Click on the knob with the <b>left</b> mouse button, keep it pressed
and move either left..right or up..down.</p>
<p> * Using the <b>mouse wheel</b>. Press Shift for smaller steps.</p>
<p>From Left to right we have:</p>
<p><b>* Note selection buttons.</b>
These select which notes are accepted as 'correct' ones. By
default all 12 are enabled. Depending on the key of the tune being
processed it can help to disable some of them. These buttons also
indicate the current note as selected by the pitch estimator.</p>
<p><b>* Pitch error meter.</b>
Indicates the pitch error of the input signal w.r.t. the current
note. The range is +/- one semitone.</p>
<p><b>* Midi indicator.</b>
Apart from the static note selection AT1 also accepts Midi
note on/off messages. If the set of notes enabled in this
way is not empty it takes priority over the static selection.
This is indicated by this button lighting up. Clicking on it
will reset any 'hanging' Midi notes.</p>
<p><b>* Tuning.</b> This sets the frequency corresponding to 
'A' pitch, in other words the required tuning. This will be
the default 440 Hz in most cases. The exact value is displayed
whenever this control is touched, and can be set in steps of 0.2
Hz.</p> 
<p><b>* Bias.</b> Normally the pitch estimator will select the
enabled note closest to the measured pitch. The Bias control
adds some preference for the current note - this allows it to
go off-tune more than would be the case otherwise.</p>
<p><b>* Filter.</b> This sets the amount of smoothing on the
pitch correction while the current note does not change. If it
does change the filter is bypassed and the correction jumps
immediately to the new value.</p>
<p><b>* Correction.</b> Determines how much of the estimated pitch
error gets corrected. Full correction may remove expression or
vibrato.</p>
<p><b>* Offset.</b> Adds an offset in the range of +/- two
semitones to the pitch correction. With the Correction control
set to zero the result is a constant pitch change.</p>
