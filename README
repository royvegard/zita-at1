Version 0.2.0 (10/12/2010)
--------------------------

* The resampler now uses cubic interpolation (at twice
  the sample rate for 44.1 and 48 kHz), giving even
  cleaner output.

* The offset control now has 400 steps of exactly 1
  cent (1/100 semitone) each, and displays the set
  value when touched. Default mousewheel step is 10
  cents, 1 cent with Shift pressed.
